Results-driven graduate of the computer science program at Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, with focus on programming and software development. Previously, a project engineer with extensive experience in building industrial systems and real-time control applications while being part of a distributed team.

I enjoy solving challenging tasks in a complex environment and learning new things. I am interested in various topics of computer science, the .NET platform, and full-stack web development. Most of my academic projects are written in C\#, TS, or C++, using No/SQL storage systems, and open data formats.
